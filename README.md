This assignment aimed to develop a web-based application to address a selected Social Challenge. The project was focused on the development of skills and knowledge in programming, front-end and back-end concepts. The objective of the project was to apply computing skills to address real-world problems. The assignment was divided into multiple milestones, starting with conducting a competitive analysis, then designing and conceptualizing the web application, developing and testing the application, and finally presenting the final product. The project was assessed based on the course learning outcomes, including the ability to design and develop ethical software applications, apply core principles of user-centred design, integrate a database into the application, demonstrate effective teamwork and communication, and identify and use strategies for improving professional practice. The project focused on the social challenge of homelessness in Australia, where the goal was to develop a web-application to raise awareness and understanding of the scale and scope of homelessness.
